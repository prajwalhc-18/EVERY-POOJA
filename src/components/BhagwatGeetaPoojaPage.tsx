            <strong>Bhagwat Geeta Pooja</strong>
          </h1>
          <p>
            Bhagavad Gita Pooja, also known as Geeta Jayanti, is a Hindu festival
            celebrated to honor the birth of the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred scripture
            that contains the teachings of Lord Krishna to Arjuna on the battlefield
            of Kurukshetra. Devotees perform this pooja with reverence and devotion
            to seek spiritual wisdom, guidance, and enlightenment from the teachings
            of the Bhagavad Gita. The pooja involves recitation of verses, offering
            of prayers, and contemplation on the profound truths elucidated in the text.
            It is considered a source of inspiration and solace for spiritual seekers
            across the world.
