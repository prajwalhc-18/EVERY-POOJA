            <strong>Ketu Pooja</strong>
          </h1>
          <p>
            Ketu Pooja is a sacred ritual performed to appease the malefic effects
            of Ketu, one of the nine celestial bodies or grahas in Vedic astrology.
            Ketu is considered a shadow planet that can cause adverse influences
            such as spiritual disturbances, accidents, and unexpected events.
            Devotees seek the blessings of Ketu to mitigate these negative effects
            and attain spiritual growth, protection, and overall well-being. The
            pooja involves recitation of mantras, offering prayers, and performing
            specific rituals to pacify Ketu and harness its positive energies.
