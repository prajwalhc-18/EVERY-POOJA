          <p>
            Nakshatra Pooja is a Hindu ritual performed to appease the celestial
            bodies known as Nakshatras or lunar mansions. These Nakshatras play
            a significant role in Vedic astrology, influencing various aspects
            of human life and destiny. This pooja aims to seek the blessings of
            the Nakshatras for prosperity, protection, and overall well-being.
