            <strong>Rahu Pooja</strong>
          </h1>
          <p>
            Rahu Pooja is a Hindu ritual performed to appease the malefic effects
            of Rahu, one of the nine celestial bodies or grahas in Vedic astrology.
            Rahu is considered a shadow planet that can cause adverse effects
            such as obstacles, delays, and confusions in one's life. Devotees
            seek the blessings of Rahu to mitigate these negative influences
            and attain success, prosperity, and overall well-being. The pooja
            involves chanting of mantras, offering prayers, and performing specific
            rituals to pacify Rahu and harness its positive energies.
