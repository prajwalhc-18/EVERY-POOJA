            <strong>Durga Pooja</strong>
          </h1>
          <p>
            Durga Puja is a major Hindu festival celebrated primarily in India,
            dedicated to Goddess Durga, the embodiment of divine feminine power.
            It typically spans nine days, culminating in the tenth day known as
            Vijayadashami. The festival involves elaborate rituals, feasting,
            and cultural events, with intricately crafted pandals (temporary
            structures) housing idols of the goddess. It symbolizes the victory
            of good over evil and marks the triumph of Goddess Durga over the
            demon Mahishasura.
