          <p>
            Gath Bandhan Pooja is a Hindu ritual that symbolizes the union of
            two souls in marriage. It involves the tying of a sacred thread
            (gath) around the wrists of the bride and groom by a priest,
            signifying their eternal bond and commitment to each other. The pooja
            is performed with prayers for a harmonious and prosperous married
            life filled with love, understanding, and mutual respect.
