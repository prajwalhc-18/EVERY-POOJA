          <p>
            Navgrah Pooja, also known as the worship of the nine celestial bodies,
            is a Hindu ritual performed to appease the nine planets or grahas
            in Vedic astrology. It aims to mitigate the malefic effects of
            unfavorable planetary positions in one's horoscope and bring about
            harmony and positive energy. Devotees seek blessings for good health,
            prosperity, success, and overall well-being by performing this pooja.
            The ritual involves chanting of mantras, offering prayers, and performing
            specific rituals dedicated to each planet to balance their influence
            and receive their beneficial aspects.
