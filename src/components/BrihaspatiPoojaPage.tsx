            Brihaspati Pooja, also known as Guru Pooja, is a Hindu ritual dedicated
            to Brihaspati, the planet Jupiter and the guru of the gods. This pooja
            is performed to seek the blessings of Brihaspati for wisdom, knowledge,
            success, and prosperity. Devotees believe that performing this pooja
            helps in mitigating the malefic effects of Jupiter in their horoscope
            and brings positive energy and opportunities in life.
