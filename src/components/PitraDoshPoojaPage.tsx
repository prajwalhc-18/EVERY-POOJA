          <p>
            Pitra Dosh Pooja is a Hindu ritual performed to pacify the ancestral
            souls or "pitras" who may be suffering due to unresolved karmic debts
            or ancestral curses. It is believed that when the pitras are appeased
            through this pooja, they bless their descendants with prosperity,
            happiness, and protection from misfortunes.

            <li>
              Pitra Dosh is a dosha or affliction in Vedic astrology caused by
              the negative influence of the pitras or ancestors in one's horoscope.
            </li>
            <li>
              It may result from unresolved issues, unfulfilled duties, or
              ancestral curses carried over from previous generations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Performing Pitra Dosh Pooja is believed to alleviate the malefic
              effects of this dosha and bring peace and prosperity to the family.
